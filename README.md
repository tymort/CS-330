# How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design from the ground up. I begin by layin out an idea of what I want to do and how I think I can complete it. This means drawing diagrams, researching methods, and forming a coherent vision. I then take this vision and begin to create a framework of it. For this project, I took an agile design approach. I focused on many small iterations over large scale feature implementation. This kept each section of the project manageable and allowed for constant improvements and bug fixes. Applying this to future work allows me to tackle any size program as I will be able to divide the work up and tackle it as I can. It will also allow me to collaborate with future coworkers and simultaneously work on seperate features. 

# How do I approach developing programs?

I approach software development from the ground up. After laying out a plan, I vreate a basic skeletal frmaeowrk. I iterate and improve upon the framework, adding features as I go and refining existing code. When I reach something I don't know how to do, I research the documentation of the library I am using as well as reaching out to other resources and forums. This allows me to constantly learn new things with each new program. This strategy could be applied to many things in the future as I am learning from my impediments, rather than letting them stop me. This improves my portfolio and skill diversity, allowing me to tackle harder things. While working on this scene, I ran into many issues with lighting and texturing. Utilizing OpenGL's documentation allowed me to better understand many of the issues that plagued my code.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is the key to reaching many of my goals. I want to become a software engineer and after many years in the field, I would like to retire and teach computer science. Therefore, computer science is integral to me. Understanding computer graphics allows me to pursue video game or other graphical interface based projects. It will also allow me to better educatge future students should they desire to head into similar fields. Having a robust knowledge of the entirety of computer science is crucial to maintaining diverse employment options as well as allowing me to better educate myself and my prospective students.
